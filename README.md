# NewPortfolio2022

My portfolio made in HTML and CSS is a dynamic and visually appealing website that showcases my skills, experiences, and accomplishments in a clear and organized manner. The HTML provides the structure of the website and the CSS provides the styling, making it look visually appealing to the user. The portfolio includes several sections such as an about page, which introduces myself and my background, a projects section, which showcases my work and its impact, a skills section, which highlights my technical and soft skills, and a contact page, which allows potential employers or clients to get in touch with me. The overall design is clean, professional, and responsive, ensuring a smooth experience for users regardless of the device they are accessing it from. With this portfolio, I can effectively demonstrate my abilities and make a strong impression on potential employers or clients.
